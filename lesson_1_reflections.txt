How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It tracks changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

The history shows the code evolution. It helps to remind reasons of definite implementations. It also helps to find ways of code optimization.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros: the most meaningful changes are saved 
	the best practice is to make commits when logical changes happen
	that means that it is easier to read them
cons: people may forget to save versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some changes influence several files, so they also should be tracked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the changes made in repository files
git diff file_version_1 file_version_2 compares the contants of these files and showes the difference between them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You always know that there is a way back. There is a possibility to create a new branch and make changes without influencing an old one.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For saving code development history, for code development in a team, for code sharing.
